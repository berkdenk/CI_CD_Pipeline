# CI/CD Pipeline Project

## 🚀 About the Project

This project aims to automate the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes for a simple Node.js application using GitHub Actions. By creating a pipeline that includes automated build, test, and simulated deployment steps upon code changes, I intend to showcase my automation skills in modern software development practices.

## ✨ Key Features and Achievements

* **Automated CI/CD Pipeline:** Implemented an automated pipeline using GitHub Actions that triggers on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.
* **Dependency Management:** Automated the installation of application dependencies via the `npm install` step, ensuring a consistent build process across environments.
* **Test Integration:** Integrated a basic test step (`npm test`) into the pipeline to verify that code changes do not break core functionality.
* **Simulated Deployment:** Instead of a real deployment target, I performed a deployment simulation as the final stage of the pipeline, demonstrating the full CI/CD flow.
* **GitHub Actions Experience:** Gained practical experience with fundamental GitHub Actions concepts, including YAML-based configuration, runners, steps, and jobs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The main technologies and tools utilized in this project include:

* **Programming Languages:** `Node.js`
* **Version Control:** `Git`, `GitHub`
* **CI/CD:** `GitHub Actions`
* **Operating Systems (Runner):** `Linux (Ubuntu-latest)`

## ⚙️ Setup and Running (For Developers)

To explore this project locally and trigger the CI/CD pipeline, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/berkdenk/CI_CD_Pipeline.git](https://github.com/berkdenk/CI_CD_Pipeline.git)
    cd CI_CD_Pipeline
    ```
2.  Install Node.js dependencies (optional, for local execution only):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the application locally (optional):
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    You can visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the "Hello from CI/CD Pipeline!" message.

4.  **Triggering the Pipeline:** After cloning the repository, pushing a new commit to the `main` branch will trigger the GitHub Actions pipeline.
    ```bash
    # For example, make a small change in app.js
    echo "console.log('New Line Added');" >> app.js
    git add .
    git commit -m "Trigger pipeline with new change"
    git push origin main
    ```
    Then, navigate to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the pipeline's progress and outcome.

## 💡 Lessons Learned and Skills Developed

* Proficiency in creating and managing complex CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.
* Effective use of `YAML`-based configuration files (workflow definitions).
* Utilizing Git events like `push` and `pull_request` to trigger CI/CD pipelines.
* Automating core CI/CD steps such as building, dependency management, and testing.
* Understanding the importance of deployment processes and creating a basic deployment flow through simulation.
